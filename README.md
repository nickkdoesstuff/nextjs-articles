This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

**Requirements**
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) *(Note: Pocketbase.exe should already be provided)*
- [Next.JS V13](https://nextjs.org/) *(Note: Version 13 required, should already be provided)*

To start, run the backend development server

```

Then, run the frontend development server **(NOTE: uses TURBOPACK (a beta feature). To disable, remove the --turbo flag from the scripts**)

```bash
npm run dev
# or
